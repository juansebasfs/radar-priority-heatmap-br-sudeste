# radar-priority-heatmap-br-sudeste
Multi-layer Leaflet heatmap and Python tooling to prioritize speed-camera placement on BR highways in Brazil (SP, MG, ES, RJ). Computes per-km accident density, a 0–100 radar priority index (min–max normalized), and generates a standalone HTML map with UF filters and layer toggles (precision, density, priority) using CartoDB tiles and leaflet.heat.
